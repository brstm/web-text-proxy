# Agent Notes Pointer

Internal operating notes live outside this repository. Create an `agents/` folder locally (it is git-ignored) to hold session docs, environment details, and TODOs.

## Quick Checklist
- `agents/overview.md` – project context and goals.
- `agents/environment.md` – devcontainer/bootstrap steps.
- `agents/status.md` – current stack details.
- `agents/outstanding.md` – next actions before closing a session.
- `agents/conventions.md` – formatting and scratch-space rules.

Keep the local copies concise, date updates as needed, and avoid committing them. Update this pointer only if the structure changes.
